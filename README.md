# qmp-windows
A tool for interacting with QEMU windows guests via QMP. With some added (optional) proxmox flair.
This uses the windows 'alt codes' (left alt + keypad sequences) to send CP437 characters to windows VMs. 

Here's a thought: You can use any Hak5 Rubber Ducky script with this tool.
Here's a ducky-to-python converter.
